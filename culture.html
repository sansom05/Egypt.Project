                    <div class="text">
                        <p> The most common way when greeting someone in Egyptian culture is by using this phrase:
                            “As-salamu alaikum,” which means peace be upon you. 
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            How one responds to this is by using
                            the phrase “Wa alaikum as-salam” which translates to may peace be upon you.
                        </p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p> Basic etiquettes such as dressing modestly, having table manners etc, are all commonly
                            practiced in Egypt. When in Egypt, as a female, make sure you dress appropriately. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This implies that in certain places, suggestive or revealing clothing may not be fitting.

                        <p>Family is an essential part of Egyptian culture. They hold a lot of value to the word family
                            as the society of Egypt can be described as a collectivist society. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Meaning that there is a strong sense of collectivism partaking among the citizens of Egypt.
                            This can help you, as a tourist, feel comfortable knowing that there are always helpful and
                            hospitable people around.</p>
