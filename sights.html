        <h1>The pyramids</h1>
        <p>The pyramids of Giza. There are three pyramids of Giza each built for their respective kings. The oldest pyramid called the Great pyramid was built for king Khufu it is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids standing at an incredible height of 147 meters. The Great pyramid is also one of the seven wonders of the world. The second pyramid was built for king Khafre, it is 143 meters. The third pyramid meant for king Menkaure is relatively small at only a height of 66 meters. These heights I described are not the current heights of the pyramids since both plunderers and time have rendered the layer of limestone that sat on the outside of the pyramids. The pyramids were built for the purpose of being tombs for their fallen leaders. These tombs have been speculated to have been filled to the brim with many different treasures. Sadly almost all of these treasures had been stolen over the years by bandits and thieves. The pyramids of Giza are truly a marvelous sight that everyone should seek to explore one day.</p>
