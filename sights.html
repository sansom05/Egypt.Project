        <h2 class="titleP">The pyramids</h2>
        <p id="pyramidT">The pyramids of Giza. There are three pyramids of Giza each built for their respective kings.
             The oldest pyramid called the Great pyramid was built for king Khufu it is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids
              standing at an incredible height of 147 meters.
              The Great pyramid is also one of the seven wonders of the world.
               The second pyramid was built for king Khafre, it is 143 meters.
               The third pyramid meant for king Menkaure is relatively small at only a height of 66 meters.
                These heights I described are not the current heights of the pyramids since both plunderers and time
                 have rendered the layer of limestone that sat on the outside of the pyramids.
                  The pyramids were built for the purpose of being tombs for their fallen leaders.
                 These tombs have been speculated to have been filled to the brim with many different treasures.
                  Sadly almost all of these treasures had been stolen over the years by bandits and thieves.
                  The pyramids of Giza are truly a marvelous sight that everyone should seek to explore one day.</p> <br>

        <h2 class="titleS">The Sphinx</h2>
        <p id="sphynxT">The Great Sphinx of Giza is a statue that likely dates back to almost 5000 years ago during king Khafre's reign.
             The Sphinx is an animal said to have the head of a human donning a royal headgear in this case the face was sculpted in king Khafreâ€™s image and with a body like a lion.
              The great Sphinx has deteriorated a great deal over the last 5000 years, now the face is very damaged.
               Historically the Sphinx is often included near many tombs and temples as it serves as a protector that would swallow any human that answered one of its riddles wrong.
                Another reason for its presence near tombs is speculated to be because of their mythical power to bring people back to life. It is also believed that The Great Sphinx of Giza was originally painted because of the residue of red paint still on it.
                The Great Sphinx of Giza Is an incredible sight to see due to its elegant details and enormous size standing at 73 meters.</p><br>

        <h2 class="titleN">The Nile</h2>
        <p id="nileT">One of the most magnificent works of nature you can witness is located in Egypt, the Nile River.
            The Nile is 6650 kilometers long making it the longest river in the world.
             Looking at the Nile is almost unbelievable, An enormous body of water going through a dry desert creating life and greenery wherever it touches.
              The Nile is formed by three main streams: the White Nile, the Atbara and the Blue Nile which all flow into the lakes Victoria and Albert.
               The Nile was the sole reason for the incredible prosperity that the ancient civilisations saw.
                As the Nile allowed its people to be one of the first civilizations to implement the various arts of farming.
                 The constant stream of water from the Nile is what made living in Egypt possible.</p>
